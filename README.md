Approach :

1)Formed all string constants in order to provide all the input param values for testing API calls

2)Formed Constants for all the api key and api end points for testing.

3) wrote the validate methods to analyze the api response body for two end points 
  History endpoint and forcast endpoint based on city id, city name, zipcode, and lattitudes, longuitudes.
  
  4)basically wrote the asserts to makeing sure all the data we got is expected formate, and values.
  
  5)validated the null checks , abd status codes .
  
  6)wrote the tests for all the invalid scenarios where passing invalid parameters and verifying the behaviours, and status codes.
